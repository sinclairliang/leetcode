     * Given an m x n 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
     * <p>
     * An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * Example 1:
     * <p>
     * Input: grid = [
     * ["1","1","1","1","0"],
     * ["1","1","0","1","0"],
     * ["1","1","0","0","0"],
     * ["0","0","0","0","0"]
     * ]
     * Output: 1
     * Example 2:
     * <p>
     * Input: grid = [
     * ["1","1","0","0","0"],
     * ["1","1","0","0","0"],
     * ["0","0","1","0","0"],
     * ["0","0","0","1","1"]
     * ]
     * Output: 3
     * <p>

     * Constraints:
     * <p>
     * m == grid.length
     * n == grid[i].length
     * 1 <= m, n <= 300
     * grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
